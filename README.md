# Systems-Modeling-and-Simulation-AUTH2021
Projects for Systems Modeling & Simulation Course / Aristotle University of Thessaloniki / Summer Semester 2021
## Part 1
The first part refers to linear parameterization and unknown parameter estimation using off-line parameter estimation techniques. Least Squares Method is used to estimate the unknown parameters of the system.First, we ensure that the parameters appear in a linear form. The two systems are:
- Mass-Spring-Damper System
- RLC System

## Part 2
The second part is the online estimation of unknown parameters. The Gradient Method and Lyapunov Method (Both Parallel and Series-Parallel methods) are used.

## Status of the project
There are more projects expected to come, this repo is active.

## Code
MATLAB R2018a version. Using a different version, you may need to customize some commands.
