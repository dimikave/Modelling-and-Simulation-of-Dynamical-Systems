# Systems-Modeling-and-Simulation-AUTH2021
Projects for Systems Modeling & Simulation Course / Aristotle University of Thessaloniki / Summer Semester 2021
## Part 1
The first part refers to linear parameterization and unknown parameter estimation using off-line parameter estimation techniques. Least Squares Method is used to estimate the unknown parameters of the system. First, we ensure that the parameters appear in a linear form. The two systems are:
- Mass-Spring-Damper System
- RLC System

## Part 2
The second part is the on-line (real-time) estimation of unknown parameters. The Gradient Method and Lyapunov Method (Both Parallel and Series-Parallel methods) are used.

## Status of the project
As of the completion of the project, it will probably be modified in case of more research in the field, but in any case it will not be maintained. It may hold inaccuracies and could be implemented in more efficient ways regarding speed and recources management.

## Code
MATLAB R2018a version. Using a different version, you may need to customize some commands.
